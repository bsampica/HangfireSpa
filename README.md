## Introduction
The goal of the HangfireSpa project is to provide a client side set of views, which interface with the HangFire server.  

In my projects, especially enterprise level development, the need for a front end that is accessable by an internal technician who isn't a developer is necessary and helpful.  

The ```/hangfire``` route isn't always preferable to deploy to production, and can cause issues with URL rewriting scenarios, or specific route based security in SPA projects, because it's not technically in the same app space as the SPA.
## What Is This
### The Idea
As a developer, business owner, and enterprise level architect and project manager, the idea is relatively simple.  

For me; the ability to deploy a securable, extensible, and configurable dashboard for hangfire, that uses the same technology and lives in the same app space, is a total win.  

Having to manage an open (alibet securable) web portal for hangfire, along side the webApi means a set of challenges that can be avoided.

## Technology
### Developers Statement
The technology choices in the project arent comprehensive.  In any production level project, the code must be reviewed, peer reviewed, unit tested, end-to-end tested, and ultimatly signed-off using best-pratices and time.  None of that has happened here...be aware this is considered a ***toy*** project at the moment, and may never be anything more.
